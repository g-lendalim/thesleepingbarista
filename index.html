  <h2>How did it started</h2>
  <p>Coffee stains, cold brew set, nitro kit.</p>
  <p>It all happened in one night. One of the nights after she took her Zolpidem.</p>
  <p>That morning, she woke up in a daze. Her kitchen was in a mess with coffee stains, opened battery packs and a nicely assembled nitro brew kit on the floor. Her coffee scale which was out of battery for weeks has finally came back to life. </p>
  <p>She stumbled upon the mess, and followed the tracks of coffee stains . It led her to the fridge in the kitchen. There was a small gap between the fridge - it was not shut properly. Inside there, she found a new cold brew set with brewed coffee in it.</p>
  <p>Who brewed the coffee? When was it done? She checked through her phone and looked through her contacts. No one seems to have came here last night. Orders were found on Shopee and Lazada, orders that she couldn’t recall.</p>
  <p>She felt goosebumps on her arms - she has made orders and payment, collected the parcels and made her very first cold brew without even a slight memory.</p>
  <p>If anyone has ever pondered how “The Sleeping Barista” got its name, Zolpidem. Zolpidem was the answer to it.</p>
